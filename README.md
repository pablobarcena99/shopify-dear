# dear: clothing



## Description

This is a project that I did for a client who wanted to create an online store for their clothing brand. The project utilizes Shopify as the CMS (Content Management System) and Next.js as the frontend framework. It incorporates features such as product listings, shopping cart functionality, and a checkout process.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: A popular React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
- Shopify: A powerful CMS for managing and organizing the project's content and eCommerce functionality.
- Styled Components: A CSS-in-JS library for styling React components with enhanced features.
- Bootstrap: A widely-used CSS framework for responsive and mobile-first web development.
